"# PicaFermeNada" 
I wrote this code during middle school, when I was first learning Python. Pica Ferme Nada is a game my sixth grade math teacher used to play frequently with my class. This code first prompts the user asking whether or not they would like the instructions. If yes, the instructions are printed out. If not, a random number is generated for the user to guess, and the user is simply prompted to enter a number. Every time the user inputs a number, a code comprising of "p"'s, "f"'s, and "n"'s is printed to give the user a clue. A "p" stands for the right digit in the wrong place, an "f" stands for a correct number in its correct place, and an "n" stands for a digit not found in the number. This cycle repeats until the user enters the correct number. The number of turns taken to guess the number is then printed.
